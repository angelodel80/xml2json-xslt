**xml2json.xslt** is a XSLT 1.0 stylesheet to transform arbitrary XML to JSON. There is also a version for javascript. The workings are demonstrated with the accompanied xml files. The target of this library is to create javascript-like JSON ([Parker convention](TransformingRules.md)), not XML-like JSON (see the [BadgerFish convention](http://badgerfish.ning.com/)).

The downside is it won't translate all markup (yet), and there's a chance the JSON is invalid. However, if you control the XML, you will enjoy the merits of javascript. Enjoy ;-) I will call this the Parker convention, after the comic Parker & Badger by Cuadrado. I can really recommend the comic, also in relation to this work and the BadgerFish convention.
